Binary Image.py can transform a satellite image into a binary image.

The purpose of this project is to compute the fractal dimension by using the box-counting method and the radial method. The input is a binary image and the output is a real number in $[1, 2]$.

Then, the Linear Regression Model.py can graph the fractal dimension and use a linear regression line to best fit the data points.
